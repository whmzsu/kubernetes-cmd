kubelet  --help
The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each
node. The kubelet works in terms of a PodSpec. A PodSpec is a YAML or JSON object
that describes a pod. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through
various mechanisms (primarily through the apiserver) and ensures that the containers
described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage
containers which were not created by Kubernetes.

Other than from an PodSpec from the apiserver, there are three ways that a container
manifest can be provided to the Kubelet.

File: Path passed as a flag on the command line. Files under this path will be monitored
periodically for updates. The monitoring period is 20s by default and is configurable
via a flag.

HTTP endpoint: HTTP endpoint passed as a parameter on the command line. This endpoint
is checked every 20 seconds (also configurable with a flag).

HTTP server: The kubelet can also listen for HTTP and respond to a simple API
(underspec'd currently) to submit a new manifest.

Usage:
  kubelet [flags]

Flags:
      --alsologtostderr                                     log to standard error as well as files
      --azure-container-registry-config string              Path to the file containing Azure container registry configuration information.
      --bootstrap-checkpoint-path string                    <Warning: Alpha feature> Path to to the directory where the checkpoints are stored
      --bootstrap-kubeconfig string                         Path to a kubeconfig file that will be used to get client certificate for kubelet. If the file specified by --kubeconfig does not exist, the bootstrap kubeconfig is used to request a client certificate from the API server. On success, a kubeconfig file referencing the generated client certificate and key is written to the path specified by --kubeconfig. The client certificate and key file will be stored in the directory pointed by --cert-dir.
      --cert-dir string                                     The directory where the TLS certs are located. If --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file are provided, this flag will be ignored. (default "/var/lib/kubelet/pki")
      --chaos-chance float                                  If > 0.0, introduce random client errors and latency. Intended for testing.
      --cloud-config string                                 The path to the cloud provider configuration file.  Empty string for no configuration file.
      --cloud-provider string                               The provider for cloud services. Specify empty string for running with no cloud provider.
      --cni-bin-dir string                                  <Warning: Alpha feature> The full path of the directory in which to search for CNI plugin binaries. Default: /opt/cni/bin
      --cni-conf-dir string                                 <Warning: Alpha feature> The full path of the directory in which to search for CNI config files. Default: /etc/cni/net.d
      --config string                                       The Kubelet will load its initial configuration from this file. The path may be absolute or relative; relative paths start at the Kubelet's current working directory. Omit this flag to use the built-in default configuration values. Command-line flags override configuration from this file.
      --container-runtime string                            The container runtime to use. Possible values: 'docker', 'remote', 'rkt (deprecated)'. (default "docker")
      --container-runtime-endpoint string                   [Experimental] The endpoint of remote runtime service. Currently unix socket is supported on Linux, and tcp is supported on windows.  Examples:'unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock', 'tcp://localhost:3735' (default "unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock")
      --containerized                                       Running kubelet in a container.
      --docker-endpoint string                              Use this for the docker endpoint to communicate with (default "unix:///var/run/docker.sock")
      --docker-root string                                  DEPRECATED: docker root is read from docker info (this is a fallback, default: /var/lib/docker) (default "/var/lib/docker")
      --dynamic-config-dir string                           The Kubelet will use this directory for checkpointing downloaded configurations and tracking configuration health. The Kubelet will create this directory if it does not already exist. The path may be absolute or relative; relative paths start at the Kubelet's current working directory. Providing this flag enables dynamic Kubelet configuration. Presently, you must also enable the DynamicKubeletConfig feature gate to pass this flag.
      --enable-server                                       Enable the Kubelet's server (default true)

      --experimental-check-node-capabilities-before-mount   [Experimental] if set true, the kubelet will check the underlying node for required components (binaries, etc.) before performing the mount
      --experimental-kernel-memcg-notification              If enabled, the kubelet will integrate with the kernel memcg notification to determine if memory eviction thresholds are crossed rather than polling.
      --experimental-mounter-path string                    [Experimental] Path of mounter binary. Leave empty to use the default mount.
      --experimental-qos-reserved mapStringString           A set of ResourceName=Percentage (e.g. memory=50%) pairs that describe how pod resource requests are reserved at the QoS level. Currently only memory is supported. [default=none]

Currently unix socket is supported on Linux, and tcp is supported on windows.  Examples:'unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock', 'tcp://localhost:3735'
      --kubeconfig string                                   Path to a kubeconfig file, specifying how to connect to the API server. Providing --kubeconfig enables API server mode, omitting --kubeconfig enables standalone mode.

      --node-ip string                                      IP address of the node. If set, kubelet will use this IP address for the node
      --node-labels mapStringString                         <Warning: Alpha feature> Labels to add when registering the node in the cluster.  Labels must be key=value pairs separated by ','.

      --register-with-taints []api.Taint                    Register the node with the given list of taints (comma separated "<key>=<value>:<effect>"). No-op if register-node is false.
